## Project Overview üéâ
<p style="text-align: center;">iTask is my first meaningful project. The main goal was to increase my skills in creating REST APIs, understanding how an authentication system works, and managing CRUD actions on the frontend. This project improved my React skills and taught me how to work with Redux. Throughout the project, I face some issues, but none of them were too big. The next project that will further increase my skills is <a href='https://github.com/HubeertC/iTools.git'>iTools</a></p>



**iTask** is a project with an authentication system where every user can create their own boards and tasks, each with different properties. The app dashboard includes a monthly goals component, user task statistics, an important task slider, and weather component, allowing users to check the current weather for a larger city.



## Features 

- Rest API handling with Redux Toolkit
- Authentication System
- CRUD functions
- task and board managment
- MongoDB integration
- component for checking the weather (for larger cities)
- User tasks statistic
